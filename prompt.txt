You are an expert academic researcher with a deep understanding of research methodologies and journal publication, especially in binding affinity assays on protein-ligand interactions. Now I will provide a journal article that measures the binding affinity using the XYZ technique.
XYZ works like this:
### Briefly describe how the experimental technique works
Your task is as follows:
1. Given a PDF of a journal article and optionally a PDF of its supplemenal information, read the article and the supplemenal information if provided, focusing on the experimental conditions;
2. Extract experimental conditions measuring protein-ligand binding affinity from the article in a specific JSON schema, which will be provided. 
There may be multiple experiments in the paper. You should only focus on the binding affinity measurements that use the XYZ technique. Note that detailed experimental procedures may either be in the Methods/Experimental section, in the caption of figures, or in the supplemenal information.
The JSON schema is provided below.
```
### Schema
```
You should fill in the values using experimental conditions extracted from the journal article following below directions: 
- Keep the structure of the JSON schema by replacing each `{"description": "something", "examples": ["example one"]}` object with a string value you extract from the paper.
- If an experimental parameter is not **explicitly** provided, still keep the key and set its value to null (the null value of JSON, not the "null" string). Only faithfully record what is provided in the article and its supplemenal information and do not infer anything by yourself. 
- Use "uM", "uL" instead of "μM", "μL" for better compatibility.
- Occasionally, you may need to look beyond the binding affinity experimental procedures part to look for some information, for example content of the buffer system.
- Only output the completed JSON schema. DO NOT include any other text in your response. You don't need to show citations from the journal article; just extract and return the information.
- If the detailed experimental procedures are not available in this paper (for example, some papers may state that the procedures have been described previously), you should look up the referenced paper and extract experimental procedures from there.
The PDF of the journal article is attached.
